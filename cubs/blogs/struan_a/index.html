			<p>Hello. My name is Struan Armstrong. I am 10 years old. I am the green lodge sixer at Newmachar Cubs. </p>
			<p>Welcome to my first ever blog. Here is a little about me.......
			I love gaming, golf and football. I am currently spending all of my time at home due to the UK being on lockdown because of the Corona Virus. Sometimes we go for a walk or a cycle near where I live. </p>


			<p>During lockdown I have been learning to cook, have been doing lots of art and maybe a little too much gaming.

			The first thing I plan to do when out of lockdown is go to see my family. I also canâ€™t wait to have my friends over for a sleepover.  </p>


			<h1>Extreme Gamer!</h1>
			<p>Ok for this blog to be called the extreme gamer of Kingseat it needs to have something to do with gaming so here goes nothing. My favourites include Fortnite and Minecraft. </p>

			<p>This time I will cover Fortnite. If you do not know what fortnite is, it is a multiplayer pvp game with loads of possibilities. The main part of the game is a 100 player pvp which you can play as a solo or a duo or in a squad with friends. This game has been great during lockdown as I have been able to play with my friends and speak to them using my headset. I would highly recommend it! </p>

			<h1>Golf</h1>
			<p>I have not been doing much golf this year but i really love playing it. I usually go to two lessons a week. My favourite club is a pitching wedge. </p>

			<h1>Chef</h1>
			<p>I have been cooking and baking a lot during lockdown. Here is a photo of me with a very very very tasty cake. </p>
